I will be doing stuff like:  

\              making classes of neurons and basic neural networks using weights and biases  

\         implementing a program to ascertain gender based on height and weight  

\              implementing number recognition from the MNIST database  

\             more weekly projects from ARIES, the AI/ML club of IITD
